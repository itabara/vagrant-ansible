# vagrant-ansible
Ansible is an open source tool which streamlines certain system administration activities. Unlike Vagrant, which provisions new machines, Ansible takes an already provisioned machine and configures it. This can include installing and configuring software, managing services, and even running simple commands.

Ansible commands are executed via SSH.

vagrant up
vagrant ssh devmaster
ping devbox
